-- S4-e HQ per-school AI usage and actual provider cost (owner direction 2026-11-02 07:56Z: "Each school has
-- independent, auditable AI usage and actual provider-cost tracking"; owner HQ authority policy 2026-10-31: HQ sees
-- per-school usage and cost). Read only: no spend path, no policy value, no program change, no provider call.
-- Proposed migration number 0197 (next after the S4 stack 0193-0196); the owner allocates the final number.
--
-- Source of truth is the existing append-only hon.ai_usage_ledger (one row per charged provider result, written by the
-- S4-a evidence path or the S4-d HQ resolution). Each school's rows are reported separately, split by spend class
-- (agent inference never mixes with creative media, AI-17) and, for agent rows, by the agent whose invocation wrote
-- the row (S4-a source_invocation_id; rows written before S4-a are reported as UNATTRIBUTED, never guessed).
-- Credits are only summed inside one spend class (legacy agent credits and creative credits are different units);
-- provider cost (micro-USD) is summed per school across classes.
-- Organization rows add the live budget picture HQ needs to act: the current window, committed credits against the
-- interim legacy ceiling (OD-23: not the creative-credit wallet), open UNKNOWN holds and any active HQ AI pause.
--
-- Cost basis is explicit (Manus review P2, 2026-11-03): a ledger row written by an HQ WRITE_OFF resolution (0196)
-- carries the owner's ESTIMATE, not a provider charge, so it is never added to the provider-reported total.
--   providerReportedCostMicrounits  rows whose cost came from the provider's own result (the S4-a evidence path) or
--                                   from provider evidence an HQ owner recorded (RECORD_PROVIDER_COST);
--   estimatedWriteOffCostMicrounits rows written by WRITE_OFF (counted separately in writeOffEntries);
--   unreconciledInvocations         calls whose outcome is still unknown (UNKNOWN, or SENDING past the stale limit,
--                                   with a hold): they have no ledger row and no known cost, so no amount is shown.
--                                   The stale test uses the immutable hold origin held_at (0196), the same predicate
--                                   as the HQ UNKNOWN queue, never the mutable updated_at.
-- Late actuals after a write-off (Manus final review P2, 2026-11-03) are reported beside, never inside, the three
-- values above, so their classification is unchanged:
--   lateProviderCostMicrounits      verified provider charges an HQ owner recorded after a WRITE_OFF
--                                   (hon.ai_late_provider_expenses, 0196), in the original hold window;
--   lateProviderExpenseEntries      how many such charges;
--   supersededWriteOffEstimateMicrounits  the part of estimatedWriteOffCostMicrounits whose call now has a late actual
--                                   (estimate minus superseded is the estimate still standing in for an unknown cost).
-- Late actuals carry no customer credits and write no ledger row, so credits and entries are unchanged.
-- The ledger, the resolution and the late-expense records are unchanged; this read only labels them.
-- Schools listed (Manus delta review P2, 2026-11-03): every school with ledger or late-expense rows in the range, and
-- every school with unresolved calls now, even with no ledger row at all; such a school shows unreconciledInvocations
-- with every amount zero and an empty byClass (no cost is invented). A school with neither is not listed. Ordering
-- (cost, estimate, then unresolved count) and the 500-school bound with its truncated flag are otherwise unchanged.
